# sugarlisp-match
SugarLisp extension adds pattern matching based on Dave Hermans pattern-match library.

#### WORK IN PROGRESS - NOT TO BE USED IN PRODUCTION

This module adds a syntax layer on top of Dave Herman's [https://www.npmjs.com/package/pattern-match](pattern-match library)

## Use

To use it insert:

  #use "match"

Near the top of your .sugar file.

## Limitations

The match dialect currently only works when using the "SugarScript" javascript-like dialect.

(expect this readme to be greatly expanded soon!)
